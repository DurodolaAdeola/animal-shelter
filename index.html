    <h2>Every year thousands of animals are dropped off at the side of the road because owners didn't properly spay or
        neuter their pets, resulting in unwanted puppies and kittens. Other times, pet owners simply cannot afford to
        take care of an animal anymore or they are moving to a home that won't allow them to bring their beloved pet
        with them. No matter what the reason, there are thousands of homeless pets on the streets of cities and
        communities all over the country. But, they don't have to be. An additional 6 to 8 million animals are already
        finding homes in shelters all across the country.
        <p>With the help of animal shelters, these animals can find homes. If you are in the market for a new pet or you
            find yourself in a situation where you are unable to keep your pet anymore, here are a few reasons you
            should choose an animal shelter:</p>
        <p>If you are in search of a family-friendly pet, check your shelter first. Many shelters have puppies and
            kittens but you may find that your heart opens up to an older animal. When you choose to adopt an animal for
            a local shelter, you can be guaranteed that your animal has been monitored and checked out by a veterinarian
            before you take them home. Animal shelters try to ensure that pets have received their shots and many dogs
            and cats will have already been spayed and neutered. Additionally, pets who have been given to the animal
            shelter from previous homes are more likely to have been exposed to children.</p>
